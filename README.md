iRoleMaster
====

A small project to make an OS X and iOS app for rolemaster RMSS, keeping in mind all parts, from map creations, 
NPCs, monstes, treasures, castles & ruins, races, professions, training packages, skills, equipment, cultures, 
and much more

This project aims at creating a full gaming platform based on RMSS, making it graphical and user-friendly, but
still keeping the pen'n'paper feel of the game. This is a way to make a fun gaming environment for those not
familiar with the RMSS gaming platform, while still attracting those who are familiar with that platform. Some 
places changes have been needed deviating from the core rules. This can be considered as house rules in the
game.
