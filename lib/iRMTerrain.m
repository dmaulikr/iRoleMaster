 * The terrain object is mainly meant for map painting, but is also a guide to generating a 3d scene of a location. Terrain also indicates what animals, monsters, plants, etc that can be found in that location. CLIMATE_CODE and LOCALE_CODE are based on the codes given in RMSS with adjustments for some added climates from aditional literature.
